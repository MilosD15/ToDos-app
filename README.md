## About 🚀

This is the pretty simple ToDo application that I made for my 
purposes, but you can use it as well. You have an option to 
add new todos and, later, you can mark them as finished and 
they will disappear, and you can mark them as unfinished, so 
they will stay there to remind you that you need to do them. 
When you close the app, all your todos will be stored in your 
local storage, and they will be rendered again every time you 
open the app. The button with the email icon on it is not 
personalized for different users, so you can't use it to send 
your todos to your email address because it is only connected 
with my email address, so every time you click that button if 
there are some todos in the list, I will receive a new email 
with that todos. However, you can still use the app if you 
like it and if you have an Internet connection. 🤗
